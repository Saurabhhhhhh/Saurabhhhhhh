# Hi, I'm Saurabh (Ritesh Kumar Verma)! 👋

Most people know me as **Saurabh**, but my official name (on documents, certificates, etc.) is **Ritesh Kumar Verma**. You'll see both names across my work—GitHub, LinkedIn, resume—but all of it is mine. 🙂

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I recently completed my **B.Tech in Computer Science** from Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University.

I'm a developer driven by curiosity and a passion for solving real-world problems. I create tools that simplify everyday tasks—whether it's automating workflows, summarizing lectures with AI, or building robotics projects with school students.

I love experimenting with:
- Python, C, C++, JavaScript
- Desktop & web apps
- Cloud & AI/ML
- Arduino, automation, and practical AI tools
